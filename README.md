<h3>Literature</h3>
<p>(1) “satura quidem tota nostra est” (Satire is Roman) – <b>Quintilian</b></p>
<p>(2) Criticized real political figures and got away with it because of his connections - <b>Lucilius (born around 180 BC)</b></p>

<p>(4) Wrote 12 books of epigrams, starting in 86 AD. He finds men’s vices funny, rather than upsetting. Pliny the Younger said that he was ‘talented, subtle, penetrating, witty, and sincere’ - <b>Martial (c. 40-103/104 AD)</b>
</p>
<p><b>Roman Law:</b></p>
<p>(1) Authors would not want to get in legal trouble with the people they attacked – they are very aware of this when they are writing.</p>

<h3>The Last Word (post-Republic)</h3>
<p>“At home all was calm. The officials carried the older names; the younger men had been born after the victory of Actium; most even of the elder generation, during the civil wars; few indeed were left who had seen the republic.” - Tacitus, Annals 1.3.7</p>
